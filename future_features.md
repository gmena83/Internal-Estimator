List of future features to implement on next session

1. Infrastrucure: Non-blocking I/O transition for Diagnostics and Logging
2. Add a constant learning and standarizing loop so each time and estimate is approved, the agent learns more about the price ranges I use.
3. Add a feature where i can hardcode the price, for cases when the client has a specific budget to use, and it will adapt the process, time and tech stack to the budget in question.
